The topic of the video is the flexibility offered by EKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service) to use a different CNI (Container Network Interface) such as Cilium. The main change discussed is the ability to create EKS clusters without the default AWS network add-ons (AWS VPC CNI, kube-proxy, and CoreDNS), allowing users to install a third-party CNI like Cilium instead.

### Key Points:
1. **CNI Flexibility**: AWS now allows users to create EKS clusters without the default network add-ons, enabling them to "bring their own CNI" like Cilium.
   
2. **Default Add-ons Removal**: By disabling AWS VPC CNI and kube-proxy during cluster creation, users can install a different CNI such as Cilium, which uses eBPF to replace kube-proxy.

3. **Benefits of Cilium on EKS**: Cilium, as a CNI, provides advanced networking features like eBPF-based kube-proxy replacement for optimized performance and enhanced network policy management.

4. **Node Group Management**: After installing Cilium, users can add node groups to make the cluster fully operational.

5. **ENI (Elastic Network Interface)**: EKS recommends using ENI mode, which allows pods to receive IP addresses directly from the VPC, eliminating the need for tunneling and improving network performance.

This new flexibility in EKS lets users customize their clusterâ€™s networking infrastructure by choosing the most suitable CNI, like Cilium, while optimizing both performance and network security.
